## Senti-Analysis-Irony

This is a **work in progress** and is not finalised.

### Description

Sentiment Analysis with relation to sarcasm and irony is a complex issue, given the nuances of spoken and written language. There are several aims that this dataset and classifier aim to do:
- Provide a strong ensemble classifier to classify whether an input 'document' (a document being a given segment of text) is ironic or not.
- Build on previous works to improve the performance of irony recognition. Previous works include:
-- **insert previous works in this list**

### Features

There are several features this code will implement:
- Reusable custom dataset setup through scraping twitter or other websites.
- User definition of tags to search for, to allow the dataset setup to be reused if required.
- Creation of an ensemble classifier for recognition of irony in a given document.

### Requirements

These scripts are built using Python 3.7, and require the following modules:
- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).
- **add to list as required**
