"I think just as tons of more ""liberal"" people have been twisting the Pope's words for sensationalist headlines (and then when corrected seem to blame anything or anyone other than their own initial misconception), this is also a pretty sensationalist headline from the other side.   I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.  

Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness""

AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith""

"Last I checked my Bible, a Jewish mob led by the Jewish priests of the time dragged Jesus to the Roman Prefect, Pontius Pilate, and basically told him to either execute the man as a traitor or they'd riot and destroy his career.

"&gt;Vermont also has yet to answer how it will cover everyone. 

Vermonter here.   Good luck to us in maintaining the necessary levels of tax revenue to effectively fund a model single payer system when we have the oldest population in the U. S.  (and growing in numbers) coinciding with watching our 20 and 30 somethings leave Vermont to pursue job opportunities and business opportunities out of state.   It's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most.    Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.   If state lawmakers want the power to provide residents with a state based healthcare solution, lawmakers must ask us Vermonters for this power by referendum and amend the state constitution upon our consent.",-1

* Psalm 37:25 I have been young, and [now] am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. 
* Psalm 112:1 Praise ye the LORD.  Blessed [is] the man [that] feareth the LORD, [that] delighteth greatly in his commandments. 
* Proverbs 13:22 A good [man] leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner [is] laid up for the just. 
* Proverbs 15:6 In the house of the righteous [is] much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 

**Wealth is a sign of wickedness. **

* Matthew 19:23-24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
* Luke 6:24 But woe unto you that are rich!  for ye have received your consolation. 
* James 5:1 Go to now, [ye] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you]. 


He sounds like he's running a business more than a ministry. 

** Via /r/politics **

* He donates the books to the church and allows them to sell them for profit.  This essentially creates a nice little tax write-off for him.  It also blurs the lines between ""profit from the book"" and money from the church.  Essentially, he is treating your church as a nice little tax-haven. 

* His salary is set by 4 other Mega-Church Pastors.  They also pay an undisclosed amount of money to each other for visiting each other's churches.  It's a ""you scratch my back I'll scratch yours"" situation.  They also refuse to reveal said salaries.  Essentially, this is a very creative and business-like approach for him and the other Mega-Church pastors to make millions while denying any responsibility in said salary.  It is no different than 5 CEOs setting pay for each other. 

* They bring in over $20 million annually.  Barely over $2 million goes to the community.  A lot of it goes to production and improvements, however, unlike nearly every other Southern Baptist church, the pastor's pay remains a secret.  From my understanding these Mega-Churches are an exemption from all other Southern Baptist bylaws, however, there is absolutely no reason to keep these salaries a secret unless there is a fear of public ridicule or shame.  All employees are also required to sign a nondisclosure form and are threatened with a lawsuit if they reveal church financials.",-1

Not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on Wall Street and banks.  Does that  translate to being a great president?  Not necessarily.  Does it translate to being a great senator?  Absolutely, because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests.  

And lastly, while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives, she doesn't exactly have that same appeal all over the country.  Middle of the road voters, the type you need to win presidential elections, still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her.

2 is an attempt to repackage Pascal's Wager.  I'm certain Pascal came before CS Lewis.

7 is a repackaging of the concept of suffering for God.  Once again, I don't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity.

minimum wage jobs were supposed to be for kids working their first jobs, part time, to get some entry-level work experience under their belt.   everyone's got to start someplace, right?   or they're for moms of school-age kids who need extra spending money and a flexible schedule of 9am - 3pm.   or they're for retirees who have investment income but want to get out of the house and just need something with low responsibility but high social interaction.   once you got a few years (and a few 25¢ raises) under your belt, you went on to better pay and better skill jobs, either during or after college. 

the problem now is that those better skill jobs haven't opened back up since 2008/2009.   so the only jobs that are available are the ones that are $9 an hour or less...  technically above minimum wage, but not liveable, and certainly not ones that demand the skills college grads and mid-20's (or older) already possess.   so if the only jobs that companies are willing to hire for are the low-skill minimum wage positions, without much hope of raises or even promotions (since a lot of companies have severed the wage increase from the title promotion), then those jobs damn well better pay enough that a single person can support themselves without having to rely on anyone else. 

if you work a second job in order to save up money to better your situation, great.   if you get a roommate in order to save up money to better your situation, great.   if you do either (or both) of those things because nobody is willing to pay enough to let you pay the rent AND eat?   no so great.",-1

"&gt; One example is a patient suffering from sleep apnea-like symptoms.  Years earlier, this patient had a blood gas test that would have confirmed the diagnosis, but the test results were hidden in a hard-to-find section of the medical record.  Without Watson, Mehta says he never would have seen the result. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""The system looks for competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms""
&gt; 
&gt; The process for finding that crucial test turns out to be remarkably similar to finding the right answer to a Jeopardy question.  Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms.  Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine.  ""It's **language processing** but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated,"" Barborak says.  That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together, and what each possible diagnosis means.

She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity.  She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going, so he grew up really believing God was his father.  Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God, because he just believed what his mother told him.  This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious, what he called the Holy Spirit.  This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did.  He looked for the truth in the present, because he believed God, his father, would try to communicate with him.

"&gt;Of course, the Obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout, but there are other culprits getting less attention – namely, global tech conglomerate CGI, which was responsible for the bulk of the execution, and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayer-funded contracts without enough accountability. 

&gt;Government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades.  Taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies' pockets, about $80bn of which goes to tech companies.  We've reached a stage of knee-jerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias, and it's damaging in multiple levels. 

&gt;For one thing, farming work out often rips off taxpayers.  While the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent, time-wasters drooling over their Texas Instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions, studies show that keeping government services in house saves money.  **In fact, contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83% more than what it would cost to do the work in-house.  Hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the US, while contractors, especially in the IT space, can ship taxpayer-funded work overseas. **

&gt;Fortunately, then, there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers' collective expense, and it is time we used them...

&gt; Witch Killings:

&gt;Enoch Adeboye is an evangelical pastor from Nigeria who promotes the existence of witches and wizards, resulting in the torture and death of young children and others in Nigeria, the wider African continent, and has also spread into Europe.  (See Ref#1)

&gt;On Christmas Day, 2010, 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was found by paramedics in the bathroom of an East London high-rise flat.  His body had been mutilated, teeth were missing, and he was covered in deep cuts and bruising. 
He had been starved and deprived of water and sleep, punched and kicked repeatedly, floor tiles smashed over his head, his teeth knocked out with a hammer, and a pair of pliers had been used to twist his ear. 
In the last four days of his life, he had suffered acts of unspeakable savagery, viciously inflicted upon him by a man he called ""uncle"" and one of his own sisters.  

&gt;Why? 

&gt;Because Eric Bikubi and Magalie Bamu, the boy’s family members, were convinced that he was a “witch”.   Debbie Ariyo, executive director of Africans Unite Against Child Abuse ...  explains that a boom in Pentecostal churches was leading to more children being accused of witchcraft. 

&gt;An average of eight children a year in Greater London are victims of abuse based on witchcraft-style exorcisms, but this only reflects cases resulting in police investigations.  
According to UK Church Statistics, 670 Pentecostal churches opened between 2005 and 2010, taking the total to 3,900 - that figure is expected to rise to 4,600 by 2015.  As a result, Ariyo fears that ""witch-branding"" will increase.  

&gt;""It is spreading like bushfire because it is a source of income,"" says Ariyo. 
""If you can charge £500 for an oil that is going to 'cure' a child of evil spirits, you are going to make money. ""

&gt;Whilst Adeboye's primary aim may be to exert power over his congregation and to extort money from relatives for cures, many people take the matter into their own hands. 
His preaching will increase the likelihood of people in a segment of the Australian community being accused of witchcraft by radical evangelicals.  Subsequently, this will increase the chance of acts of torture and murder being committed like the case in the UK, referred to above. 

&gt;If torture and murder are the result of this sort of evangelical preaching in a developed Western nation like England, then there is every reason to expect heinous acts to be committed here if the Australian government grants access to this man known for hate-mongering, acts of evil and causing great harm to others.   (See Ref#2,3,4,5,6 and 12)

&gt;Anti- Homosexuals:

&gt;Adeboye is currently campaigning, from the pulpit, for a proposed Nigerian law making Same Sex Marriage an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. 
Additionally, he is increasing the danger to anyone seen as being ‘pro-gay’, potentially causing journalists to be too afraid to report the truth. 
In effect (if not intentionally) Adeboyes campaigning will essentially lead to the outlawing of organizations that provide services for gay people, including HIV/AIDS clinics. 

&gt;The Nigerian anti-gay law has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament.  In addition to criminalising Same Sex Marriage, it also punishes public displays of same sex affection by up to ten years jail.   The bill is only awaiting the President's signature to become law. 

&gt;The U. S.  ambassador to Nigeria has said that Enoch Adeboye is not in line with international human rights laws.  

&gt;There are serious concerns in the Australian community that some of Adeboye’s ignorant, vulnerable congregation will interpret what he is saying (""Same-sex marriage is an anathema to the will of God"") to mean that it is ‘god's will’ for them to rid the world of homosexuals.    (See Ref#7,8 and 9)",-1

Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo! 

So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file). 

Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf? 

So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs). 

Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though. 

Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee! 

So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day! 

Now stupid Obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance :( boooo That's going to be like 70$ a month.  EVERY month!  You even have to pay in December!  Come on government, it's baby Jesus birthday, fucking dicks.",1

"While Dick is an ass hat, it is generally considered to be in the interest of national security to keep the President and Vice President healthy.  A VP not accepting these surgeries on moral grounds would be potentially hazardous in other ways.  Now, he could have paid for them on his own, but the US government has a vested interest in keeping him alive.  Also, taking advantage of what is available, while still not believing it should be available, doesn't necessarily make him a bad person.

"Moore is a big supporter of Veterans.   He runs an organization that focuses on getting Veterans jobs when they come home. 

He is simply pointing out the hypocrisy of the vapid ""Support our troops"" types that actually don't do a fucking thing to support our troops, and don't even realize how bad off a lot of Veterans are when they come home. 

Here is an op-ed he wrote that explains his position pretty well:  [Those Who Say 'I Support the Troops' Really Don't](http://www. huffingtonpost. com/michael-moore/support-the-troops_b_2402749. html)

"Something I read earlier today:

"Edit: I'll preface with this:The title and article linked above is a misconception of most progressives because:

(Most) republicans are believers in the Free Market.  I may get nuked for this, but the Tea Partiers/conservatives/republicans don't have a plan because *no plan is necessary*.  Because if you remove the laws holding back entrepreneurs from starting a business, they will 'fill the hole' with a service/product at competitive prices, because others will be offering same/similar product/services.  This competition is what drive prices down.  *Customers voting with their money. *

It's a perfect example of the argument of Centralized planning&amp;control vs.  free market. 

One of the arguments for years is that if insurance companies could (in the past) have offered plans nation-wide, rather then limited by state borders, the dollar cost averaging of health care would have been more effective. 

anyway, my 2 cents.",-1
"This is an interesting point.  There are no shortcuts in materials engineering. 

Cheap 3D printers may be great for prototyping and for soft materials, e. g.  in the range of plastic up to lighter structural metals. 

But some kind of tools requires specific materials, that requires very specific processing that may be hazardous (high temperatures, fumes, toxic byproducts) and costly (energy, short lifespan of machinery when working hard parts, long post production testing... ). 

If 3D printing is the silver bullet for an industrial process, I expect the first ones to embrace it being professional operators, where any edge over competitors means millions, and I expect some delay (if ever) for the process being accessible for general purpose low cost equipment. 

And, last but not least, I don't expect a single process, even if flexible and advanced as 3D printing, to be ever able to replace any other kind of specialized processing.  Molding, laser cutting, welding, machining...  each single process is more effective in its context.",-1
